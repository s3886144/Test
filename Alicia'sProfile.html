					<h2>Alicia Profile</h2>

					<p><strong>Overview</strong>: An app, designed for online children&rsquo;s story book reading, targeted at parents with young children. Similar to an audio book, BUT with the personalisation of the parents being able to record their voice reading the story and also having the story book illustrations for the children to enjoy.<br />The app will allow parents to record their voice reading their favourite stories to their children. Children will be able to interactively learn to read their favourite story books, whilst listening to their parents recorded voice.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: This app would be useful for parents and young children, as parents will have the ability to personalise and connect with their children, whilst the child is accessing the app and listen/reading their favourite online story book. This app development would allow parents to read their children&rsquo;s favourite story on demand for the child. In some cases, parents will not have to read the same book over and over again, as the children will be able to hear the parents voice reading the story, simple by accessing the app, where the parents have pre recorded their voice telling the story. This will free up some time for some parents, and effectively provide some form of comfort to the child who needs their parents to read a book on demand.</p>
					<p>My motivation for this idea has been driven by the personalised experience that the children will gain, by hearing a familiar voice and not a system generated robotic voice telling the story. The children will hear the tone, pitch, accent and mannerism that they are used to hearing from their parents reading the story aloud with book in hand. The apps is designed to help parents.</p>
