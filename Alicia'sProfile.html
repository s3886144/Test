						Alicia North
						PLASSS-tech
						Student number: s3886144
						Nationality & Culture: Australian
						Education to date: Diploma of Information Technology, ITIL Foundation Certificate in IT Service Management
						Language spoken: English
						Interesting fact about me: I never studied anything to do with computers at high school.

						Around the time I finished school and entered the workforce, I suddenly developed a keen interest in IT. I was forced to learn 							the basics of computing and from there my curiosity continued to grow, as did my skill set. To my amazement, I had the ability to 						pick things up and learn quickly, I soon realised that computers and software were not that difficult to use, this was a real turning point in my developing interest in IT and my education pathway.
						Now I have a strong passion for IT, dedicated over 10years working in the field, and I have operated in many roles where I assist others to develop their skills using different technologies in the educational sector.
